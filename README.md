# Hi, Iâ€™m Nikhil Muralidharan ðŸ‘‹

Analog/Mixed-Signal Design Engineer | Imaging & Vision | Irvine, CA

Iâ€™m an Analog Design Engineer at OMNIVISION, building circuits that power imaging and vision systems. I enjoy tackling hard signal-chain problems, digging into device physics, and turning simulations into silicon. Previously, I worked across RF systems, power management, and network engineering; at UC San Diego I focused on synthesizer/VCO design and analog ICs.
